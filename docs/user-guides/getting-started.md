# Getting Started with My Race Engineer

**Welcome to My Race Engineer!** This guide will help you get started with the
platform and learn the basics of using MRE to track and analyze your RC racing
performance.

## Introduction

My Race Engineer (MRE) is a comprehensive RC racing telemetry platform that
helps you discover, import, and analyze race event data from LiveRC. Whether
you're a casual racer or a competitive driver, MRE provides the tools you need
to understand your performance and improve your racing.

- Ensure your account hasn't been locked due to too many failed attempts

## Understanding the Welcome Page

After logging in, you'll see the Welcome page with the message:
