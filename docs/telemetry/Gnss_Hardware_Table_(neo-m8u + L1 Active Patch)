## Hardware required

| Component                             | What to buy                                                                | Why you need it                                                  | Key specs to match                                                           | Supports NRTK via NTRIP over internet | Supports PPP-RTK over internet | Notes for your build (RC + F722)                                                                                                                                                           |

| GNSS receiver                         | u-blox NEO-M8U module (preferably on a breakout board)                     | Provides GNSS plus onboard accel and gyro for dead reckoning     | UART output, UBX support, supply voltage depends on breakout                 | No                                    | No                             | M8U is not an RTK rover, it does not consume RTCM in a way that yields centimetre RTK fixed results. It can benefit from standard GNSS improvements but not true RTK correction workflows. |
| GNSS antenna                          | Small L1 active patch antenna (ideally 25 x 25 mm)                         | Better reception under a body shell, LNA boosts signal           | L1 band around 1575 MHz, active gain typically 20 to 28 dB, low noise figure | Indirect                              | Indirect                       | Antenna choice affects baseline GNSS quality, which helps any later RTK system too, but the antenna itself does not implement NTRIP or PPP.                                                |
| Antenna cable and connector           | Cable and connector matching your GNSS board, typically u.FL or SMA        | Physically connects antenna to receiver                          | Correct connector type, keep coax short                                      | No                                    | No                             | Avoid long cables coiled inside the car.                                                                                                                                                   |

## Important clarification

This table is for an **M8U plus L1 active patch** solution.

* **NRTK via NTRIP** and **PPP-RTK over internet** are **RTK-class correction workflows** intended for **RTK rover receivers**, typically multi-band receivers such as the **u-blox ZED-F9P** class.
* The M8U is primarily a **dead reckoning GNSS** receiver. It can be excellent for continuity through brief signal interruptions, but it is not the right receiver family for centimetre-class RTK corrections.

If you want a version of this table for the RTK build, the key additions will be:

* RTK rover receiver (ZED-F9P class)
* corrections client (NTRIP client device)
* internet transport hardware (hotspot or LTE)
* subscription credentials and mountpoint configuration
